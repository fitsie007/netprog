	* Released as version 1.1.

	* Created a Debian package.

	* sock.c, configure.in: Portability fixes for FreeBSD, Solaris and IRIX.

	* sock.c (main): Cast arg 4 of setsockopt to void * (portability).

	* sock.c (sigchld_handler): Use waitpid instead of wait3 (portability).

	* sock.c (setup_sigchld): Use memset instead of bzero (portability).

	* Makefile.in (clean): find: Use "-o" instead of "-or" (portability).

	* sock.1: Updated the man page.

	* sock.c: Added the "-n" (avoid reverse DNS lookups) switch.

	* sock.c: Inverted the "-e" switch: default is now to terminate
	after seeing EOF in both direction.

	* sock.c: When an address is missing, assume localhost.
	This way "sock :23" etc. works as expected.

	* sock.c: Reworked allocation of sockaddr's, so UNIX domain
	sockets work with long filenames.
